## Notes

This was the first mobile application I have ever created. Initially, it felt like I was thrown to the
wolves, but now I feel as if I have a deeper understanding of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete),
something not previously taught to me in my courses. Although, it's going to take a few more lessons
to really cement that knowledge.

    Some problems I encountered:

    - Importing the 'org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils' package because Studio recognized FileUtils
        as within the android package.

    - Trouble deciding where to put the GitHub repositories folder. Not sure if file structure is
        conventional.

    - Minor problems with 'git config user.name' and 'git config user.email' functionality when
        pushing to GitHub on the command line.
